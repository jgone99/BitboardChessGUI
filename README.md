## üß© Overview

This project is a **fully functional chess game** built with **C++17** and **Qt 6**, implementing the game logic using **bitboards** for high performance and clean move generation.  
It includes a **graphical user interface (GUI)** that supports:

- Piece selection and highlighting of legal moves  
- Move execution with real-time board updates  
- Game state management (turns, captures, etc.)  
- Optional move history navigation (undo/redo or click to restore past states)
